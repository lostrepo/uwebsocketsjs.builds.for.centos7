# Personal builds
Notice: *Better build from source yourself*  

Native addons built from *modified* versions of uWebsockets, uSockets, uWebsockets.js git repos  
Native addons built in CentOS 7.x and for CentOS 7.x  
Modifications probably will touch only build process but you better off following advice in above Notice  
If you are too lazy - use on your own risk (maybe I'm secretly farming crypto, ha-ha)  

Created as backup in case I won't have access to local repo. Also prevents from installing additional packages required for build on public server  

Naming: `<version>_node_modules`  
Usage: put content of `<version>_node_modules` folder into `node_modules` folder of your project
